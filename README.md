# Responsive-Portfolio
This is a responsive portfolio to highlight information about myself including projects I have completed and where to see more work history and projects.

It includes three pages: an about me page, a portfolio page, and a contact page, all which can be toggled through using the navagation bar.


The links on the portfolio page will direct you to my LinkedIn account and my Github page.
